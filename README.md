This project analyzes the dataset “U.S. Gasoline and Diesel Retail Prices (1995–2021)” to explore long-term fuel price trends, historical patterns, and variations over time.

The project combines Python, Tableau, and D3.js to create both static and interactive data visualizations. These visualizations are presented through a multi-page website, allowing users to explore insights through charts, dashboards, and interactive elements.

## Dataset
- **Name:** U.S. Gasoline and Diesel Retail Prices (1995–2021)  
- **Time Period:** 1995 – 2021  
- **Description:** Historical retail gasoline and diesel price data across the United States  
- **Purpose:** Analyze long-term trends, price fluctuations, and comparative fuel behavior  


## Tools & Technologies
- **Python** – Data cleaning, preprocessing, and chart generation  
- **Tableau** – Static and exploratory visualizations  
- **D3.js** – Interactive and dynamic visualizations  
- **HTML / CSS / JavaScript** – Website development and styling  


## Project Structure
The project is organized as a multi-page data visualization website:

- A main landing page serves as the entry point and provides navigation across the project.
- Dedicated pages present static visualizations that highlight gasoline and diesel price trends over time.
- Interactive visualization pages showcase D3-based charts that allow users to explore patterns through built-in interactivity.
- Dashboard-style pages combine multiple visualizations to present broader analytical insights.
- Individual visualization pages focus on specific chart types or analytical perspectives.
- A shared stylesheet ensures consistent styling across all pages.
- A centralized assets folder stores exported charts and visualization images used throughout the site.


## Visualizations Included
This project contains a wide range of visualizations distributed across multiple pages, including:

- Line charts analyzing long-term gasoline and diesel price trends  
- Scatter plots highlighting price relationships and variation  
- Heatmaps showing intensity and temporal patterns  
- Stacked area charts for comparative trend analysis  
- Stacked and grouped bar charts for categorical comparisons  
- Interactive D3 visualizations with hover effects, transitions, and dynamic updates  
- Multi-chart dashboards combining multiple visual insights on a single page  

Both **static** and **interactive** visualizations are included to demonstrate different analytical and presentation approaches.
