    <h2>Scatter Plot Matrix of U.S. Gasoline Grade Price Correlations</h2>
    <img src="charts/D3scatterplot.png" alt="Scatterplot Matrix" />

    <p>
        This scatter plot matrix compares gasoline prices across multiple fuel categories, 
        including Regular, Midgrade, All Grades, and Diesel. Each cell in the matrix shows a 
        pairwise relationship between two fuel types, allowing us to visually analyze how their 
        prices move together over time. The strong diagonal patterns indicate that prices for 
        different fuel types follow very similar trends, reflecting high correlation. Clusters 
        of points reveal periods where certain fuel grades are consistently higher or lower 
        than others. This visualization helps identify pricing patterns, similarities, and 
        variations across different gasoline categories in a clear multi-dimensional format.

    <h2>Heatmap of U.S. Gasoline and Diesel Retail Prices (1995–2021)</h2>
    <img src="charts/Heatmap.png" alt="Gasoline Price Heatmap" />

    <p>
        This heatmap visualizes weekly U.S. gasoline and diesel retail prices from 1995 to 2021 
        across different fuel categories. Each column represents a specific gasoline or diesel 
        grade, while each row corresponds to a week in the timeline. The color intensity 
        indicates the price level, with darker shades representing lower prices and brighter 
        shades indicating higher prices. This visualization clearly highlights long-term trends, 
        such as the sharp rise in gasoline prices during the mid-2000s, fluctuations around 
        economic events, and the overall cyclic nature of fuel pricing. The heatmap offers an 
        intuitive way to observe patterns, price spikes, and seasonal variations over nearly 
        three decades of fuel market data.
